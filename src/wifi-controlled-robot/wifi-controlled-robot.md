# WiFi Controlled Robot


## Concept
---
Remote controlled rescue and reconnaissance vehicle used in situations where people are unable to help. Programmed and controlled through Arduino, and contains various sensors for collecting data. The robot is controlled over the WiFi by a computer.


## Applications
---
Rescue and reconnaissance are two of the future applications. There are many times when wired robots cannot be used in rescues and reconnaissance, because the wires would tangle up when moving around. It is very difficult and time-consuming to untangle them remotely, which wastes time in a rescue. Time is life.

Due to the limitations of Bluetooth, rescue and reconnaissance robots have a limited communication bandwidth. This limits the amount of sensors and equipment the robots can use, such as 360&deg; camera, microphone, earthquake sensors, infrared temperature detection camera, etc... Not to mention the accelerating development of the internet and wireless internet communication. Wireless and high speed are the advantages of a network controlled robot that Bluetooth and wires cannot have and characteristics that make network controlled robots stand out. With that said, there are way more applications of this technology in the future than just simply a rescue and reconnaissance vehicle.
